Here’s a compelling and complete draft for your hackathon submission, Elizabeth. I've taken your core message and fleshed it out with engaging language and structure to highlight the innovation behind **n1**:

## 🧠 Inspiration  
Dating apps often focus on surface-level interests or mutual swipes, leaving users wondering *why* they matched. We wanted to reimagine connection by revealing the cultural threads that weave people together—music tastes, cinematic obsessions, thematic fascinations. **n1** dives deeper, blending psychology, media preferences, and taste mapping to make matches feel intentional and insightful.

## 💡 What It Does  
**n1** is a dating app that gives users **Deeper Insights, Not Just Matches**. When users match, the app doesn’t just say _“You matched!”_ — it adds context: _“You both share a taste for dystopian themes, synthwave music, and a love for Blade Runner.”_ This transforms a swipe into something meaningful.

Beyond matches, the **Taste Explorer** enables users to discover cultural affinities and their own taste profile—even if it doesn’t lead to a direct connection. It’s a space for self-awareness, exploration, and discovery.  
Our **Why We Match** engine explains compatibility using nuanced keywords, moving well beyond basic interest tags. The system mimics Qloo’s philosophy by simulating deep, tailored recommendations and connections across categories.

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
- **Frontend**: Crafted in **React** for responsive UI and real-time interactions  
- **Backend**: Powered by **Express.js**, with dynamic routing and modular APIs  
- **Taste Compatibility Logic**: Custom-built `getTasteCompatibility` algorithm analyzes semantic overlaps and thematic affinities  
- **AI Integration**: Leveraged taste-based recommendation models to simulate cultural mapping  
- **Data Simulation**: Extended metadata model to reflect user affinities across genres, moods, and styles

---

## 🧗 Challenges We Ran Into  
- Uploading and storing **picture URLs** reliably across environments  
- Smoothly **integrating AI services** to enhance user insights without slowing performance  
- Building a flexible taste taxonomy that remains meaningful but lightweight  
- Mapping non-obvious compatibility triggers while avoiding bias or overfitting

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of  
- Successfully implemented **AI-powered compatibility scoring**  
- Developed an intuitive **"Why We Match"** explanation framework  
- Built a functioning **Taste Explorer** prototype with category-spanning recommendations  
- Created a seamless, modern UI and API that opens doors for further personalization

---

## 📚 What We Learned  
- Taste is more than preference—**it’s a window into identity**  
- Compatibility isn't binary; it thrives on nuance, shared experiences, and emotional resonance  
- Building meaningful recommendations requires both **technical precision** and creative empathy  
- AI can enhance intimacy and insight when used responsibly and artfully
